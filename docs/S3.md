* S3 is private by default. Only the account root user has access to an S3 bucket by default
* One can be given access to S3 using Resource Policy
* Resource policies can allow or deny access to identities outside their own account vs identity policies which can give or deny access to identities only within their account
* Resource policies can give anonymous access
* ACLs are one more way of managing access to S3, but AWS does not recommend this

# Object Versioning

* Controlled at bucket level, starts of as disabled
* It can be enabled but once enabled it can not be disabled
* It can be suspended and then re-enabled
* When versioning of a bucket is disabled, id of that bucket is null
* When versioning is enabled, everytime a new version is uploaded, an object with new version is created
* S3 does not change the old version or its id but points to this new id as the current version
* If an object is accessed without mentioning id, its current version is returned

## Deletion of versioned objects
* If delete is requested of a versioned object without specifying a version, S3 simply adds a new special version of the object called delete marker. This simply hides the object
* If you delete , delete marker the deletion is undone
* When you delete an object by using id, that specified id only deleted
* When you delete the current version, immedite previous version becomes the current version
* All versions of the object occupy space & hence billed independently
* Even if versioning is disabled, all existing version continue to occupy space & hence billed
